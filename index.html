                                <p>Each manufacturer has specific recommendations regarding how frequently you need to change your oil.  They will also recommend specific oil weights based on temperature and riding conditions.  It is absolutely essential that you change your oil at least as often as recommended.  Many machines have very small oil reservoirs in order to keep weight and size to a minimum.  These machines take abuse and generate a lot of heat.  With such a small amount of lubrication available to your engine, it is necessary to keep your oil fresh.</p>

                                <p>Most people will bring in their machines to have a top end rebuild when they start to experience engine performance issues.  This is not a good idea.  This can lead to additional damage to your engine which can lead to expensive repairs. 
                                    What we advise is that you plan to schedule this service during the off season months when you are not planning on using your machine as frequently.  If that means that you are performing the service slightly sooner than recommended, you will be in good shape for next season.  Like most things on these high-performance machines, if you keep up on the maintenance schedules, you will have a much lower cost of ownership over the life of your machine.

                                <p>For some reason, suspension service, including bearing grease or replacement, is the most common thing people neglect on their machines.  Interestingly enough, it is probably the most important service if you want to keep your machine performing in a safe and comfortable manner.
                                    We try to encourage our customers to have their suspension bearings serviced at least once a year.  Like engine oil, this is a disposable component in your machine.  It should be changed somewhat frequently.

                                <p>I really wish there was a simple answer for this frequently asked question. In all honesty, there isn’t.  As easy as it is to say, all engines need spark, fuel, and compression, there are a lot of things that contribute to each of those three diagnostic branches.  What you should not do is toss a bunch of services and parts at a problem in the hope that something works.  We believe the best practice is to go through the machine with a fine tooth comb while isolating what is NOT causing the problem.  We believe this deduction method of diagnostics is the best practice for a couple of reasons.  First, even though it may take more time, it does not result in additional cost in parts and service that was not necessary in the first place.  Second,you gain the added benefit of checking out the functionality of other systems or parts to be sure they are working properly. This gives additional peace of mind to our customers.</p>

                                <p>The biggest indication that your valves need an adjustment is when your machine has difficulty starting.  If you find that you are cranking the engine for more than a few seconds, it is likely time for an adjustment.  The good news is that a valve adjustment usually isn’t as big of a deal as people think.  The process usually does not take much time (depending on your machine).</p>

                                <p>We offer free suspension clinics on a monthly basis for people who want a general overview of how your suspension is intended to work on your machine.  In these clinics, we try to go over the concepts behind compression and rebound and how to best track your changes to optimize performance based on various conditions.  We discuss spring preload adjustments for various types of machines from dirt bikes to UTVs.  These settings can change depending on conditions, weight, and use.  Knowing how to fine tune these settings will make your experience more enjoyable.</p>

                                <p>We work on just about everything.  In fact, we’ve even modified an old tractor so that it could compete in a tractor pull competition.  We can service, repair, modify, or upgrade anything from jet skis to side-by-sides.  We do work on snowmobiles to snowbikes.  Basically, if you already think it goes fast, chances are we can make it go faster. </p>

                                <p>Even if you don’t rip on your machine very often, tires will tend to go bad after about five years.  The natural oils in the rubber will start to try out causing the tire to crack.  Obviously, this is dangerous.  We can usually do a tire within a couple of hours even if you don’t want to take your wheels off of your bike.  When we change tires, we inspect wheel bearings to be sure those are in good shape.</p>

                                <p>When your engine seems to cut out or “bog” when you rip the throttle, this usually means your fuel to air mixture is off.  If you are running a carburetor in your machine, you may just need to have it cleaned or adjusted.  If you’ve made a modification to your machine that might impact the fuel / air mixture (such as an aftermarket exhaust), you may need to modify your carburetor or fuel injection system to account for that change.</p>
